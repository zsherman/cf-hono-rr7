# React-Router + Hono template, on Cloudflare

If this is you...

- You like building your frontend applications with React + React-Router
- You like building your APIs with Hono
- You want both to live in the same repo to share code
- You want to run both using Vite for fast developement
- You want to deploy to Cloudflare?

Then, you've come to the right place! This is a template React-Router, Hono, Vite, Cloudflare project, ready for you to get started! Just run this command to get started with a new project:

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template thomasgauvin/react-router-hono-cloudflare
```

That's it! Now, run your project locally with:

```
npm run dev
```

And deploy with:

```
npm run deploy
```

### Why put this template together?

There's a lot of templates out there showing you how to run React-Router and Hono but most of them are outdated (as of June 2025) because React-Router, Hono and Cloudflare Vite support have evolved a lot over the past 6 months.

There's been great work put into [react-router-hono-server](https://github.com/rphlmr/react-router-hono-server) and [remix-hono](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-hono). But, as of June 2025, those solutions aren't ideal for hosting on Cloudflare Workers.

[Agcty](https://github.com/agcty) [actually pointed out that it's really simple to configure RR + Hono + Cloudflare](https://github.com/rphlmr/react-router-hono-server/issues/115#issuecomment-2787089066), in light of recent developments in Cloudflare, Vite and React Router. This repository makes it easier to get a project started with this stack and makes it (hopefully) easier to discover that this is how to set this up (because I think it's a great stack, and I'll be using it myself to refer back to how to set this up).
 
This project is very simple. It's just the [original deployment template for Cloudflare and React Router ](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/cloudflare) with a small change to use Hono to serve the React Router project, allowing Hono routes to take effect and fallback to React Router:

```diff
+ import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { createRequestHandler } from "react-router";

declare module "react-router" {
  export interface AppLoadContext {
    cloudflare: {
      env: Env;
      ctx: ExecutionContext;
    };
  }
}

const requestHandler = createRequestHandler(
  () => import("virtual:react-router/server-build"),
  import.meta.env.MODE
);

- export default {
-   async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
-     return requestHandler(request, {
-       cloudflare: { env, ctx },
-     });
-   },
- } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

+ const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>();

+ app.all('*', (c) => {
+   return requestHandler(c.req.raw, {
+     cloudflare: { env: c.env, ctx: c.executionCtx as ExecutionContext },
+   });
+ });

+ export default app;
```
